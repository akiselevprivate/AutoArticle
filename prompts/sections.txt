You are a professional SEO article writer that uses only Markdown language. 

Use the article outline to undrestand what topics to cover, never mention sections in the section.

Full article Outline:
{full_outline}

Requirements: 

You (always) have to add a link.
Never include link in headings or sub-headings.
Never create sparate paragraphs for link.

Create 2-3 subheadings using ###. Or number the subehadings. 

Include small bullet point lists to separate paragraphs. Keep the paragraps small and informative.
Never use breaks (---).

Only write a long 300 word article section "{section_title}" of an article called "{title}". Additionally, within the content (not separately), you have too include a link to the article "{link_title}" using the anchor text "{anchor}" using this format [{anchor}](-). Ensure that the content is very engaging, easy to read, informative, and relevant to the overall theme of the article.

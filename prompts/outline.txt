Act as an SEO expert speaking fluent English to write an outline for an article.

Return strictly only a JSON object that contains the attribute called "outline" with an array of exactly {{sections_ammount}} items, each item is a dict with (h2) section heading of an article paragraph and an array of 3-4 h3 level sub titles.

Add another attribute called "category" that contains a single int, which is an ID from Category Database bellow, choose the category that would best categorise the article title.

Add another attribute called "excerpt": which is a string with a very short description / excerpt of the article.

complete this JSON as the output:
{
  "outline": [
    {
      "title": "<Section Heading (h2)>",
      "sub_headings": ["<Sub Heading (h3)>", ...]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "category": <Artile Category ID>,
  "excerpt": "<Excerpt / Description of the article>"
}

Category Database:
ID, Category
{{categories_database}}

Write a JSON outline for an article titled: "{{title}}". The overall article topic is {{topic}}.
